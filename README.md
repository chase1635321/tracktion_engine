## Arppegiator sequencer
 - Curses interface for viewing melody
 - Can press keys to generate corresponding chord, move up/down to invert, add 7, 2, 3 etc to make it a 7th chord, etc

## Modular automation functions
 - Command to record a track many different times, detune slightly, and spread
 - Can use to integrate modular with stock plugins. Several computer inputs, each one can have an effects chain
